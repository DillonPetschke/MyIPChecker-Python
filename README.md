# MyIPChecker-Python

This script will automatically create a Blacklist folder and download the latest lists of known infected, malicious, or compromised IP addresses.  
After downloading threat intel lists, it will check all IPs listed in MonitorList against the known infected lists and display any matching results.

To use, insert the IPs to be monitored into MonitorList.txt and place it inside of the same directory you are running MyIPChecker from.

Run as: python3 MyIPChecker.py
